Notes about how Curses works (extracted from worm lab)
#include <curses.h> <-it has key bindings, also is Curses

adding characters to the screen uses addch, takes param, enum of the character, or mvaddch which takes y value (row) x value (column) and then again enum of a character

screen is a 2d array with rows (screen_row) and columns (screen_column), both 2 off from initial row (need to add 2)

we will be responsible for figuring out how to scroll, curses seems to from examples, be able to easily scroll down when runs out of space. seems to conform to initial terminal size.
^found by looking @ p2p

refresh(); can be used to update display

drawing a display can be a constant while loop, but maybe could be more static since we're not trying to animate

reading characters saves them as integers

start curses with the line WINDOW* mainwin = initscr();

keypad(mainwin, true) allows at least arrow keys, maybe all keys (probably need to do something similar for having mouse support)
nodelay(mainwin, true) supports non blocking keyboard access
delwin(mainwin) cleans window
endwin() closes window

putting lines in: use instr to read text currently in window, clrtoel to erase it (leaving a blank line), and addstr to put the erased content one line down. insert would move us up, and this would not support inserts in the middle of lines but something to start with? (from stack overflow called add-a-line-in-ncurses)

do we want to have a cursor? if so, how?

STILL TO FIND OUT: how to sychronize windows: could repeatedly save to disc and reload, and make sure contents of window are in sync with file on disc. Could also involve clients having local copies that get used to push changes to a main. <-Leah's suggestion
^ to this, our locks would probably work best if its all writing to one file, not copies, otherwise we'll get a merge conflict-esque thing
